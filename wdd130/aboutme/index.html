<h2>Taegan Irving</h2>
<p>My name is Taegan Irving and I am from the amazing state of Oklahoma! My dad was in the Air Force so we travelled around a lot but we landed in Oklahoma and decided to stay! This is my 2nd semester here at BYU-Idaho! Im on the lookout for an eternal companion so, yes I am single. 
    I love to be with friends, play Pickleball, and watch football! I just came home from my mission in August of 2023, I served in the Washington Spokane Mission and absolutely loved it! 
    I love being here at BYU-Idaho and meeting new people everyday. I am excited to continue to learn this semester and progress towards a rewarding career</p>
